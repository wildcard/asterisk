codebase_summary: |
  Asterisk is a Tauri v2 monorepo desktop application combining Rust backend
  performance with TypeScript frontend flexibility. The project focuses on form
  detection and AI analysis capabilities. Currently has CI/CD via GitHub Actions
  with build, test, and release pipelines. The monorepo structure places the main
  desktop app in apps/desktop/ with clear separation between Rust backend
  (src-tauri/) and TypeScript frontend (src/). The project uses modern tooling
  (Vite, TypeScript) and appears to be in early development stages with core
  infrastructure in place.

next_steps:
  immediate:
    - "Explore existing form detection code (if any) in apps/desktop/src/"
    - "Review AI analysis integration points"
    - "Determine which features to build first"

  recommended:
    - "Set up testing framework (vitest recommended for TypeScript)"
    - "Document form detection requirements"
    - "Plan AI model integration architecture"

session_notes:
  - "Project detected as Tauri v2 monorepo"
  - "User goal: Feature development (form detection + AI analysis)"
  - "No test framework detected - may need to add"
  - "CI/CD already configured via GitHub Actions"
  - "Cross-terminal coordination available via PostgreSQL database"
